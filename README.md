Using ML methods to predict P2P loan rate


## Predicting Loan Rate on P2P Platforms Using LendingClub Dataset


The emergence of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending has revolutionized the loan market by directly connecting borrowers with investors. A pivotal aspect of this market is the determination of appropriate loan rates. Loan rates are crucial as they reflect the risk associated with lending money. It also significantly influences the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the investor’s return on investment. If the loan rate is too high, the debtors might default and fail to meet the repayment deadline. The creditor cannot get a satisfactory investment return if the loan rate is too low.

Our primary research objective is to use the LendingClub dataset to develop a predictive model for loan rates. This model aims to estimate the interest rate assigned to a loan based on various predictors. These predictors could include borrower-specific information such as credit score, income level, employment history, and loan-specific details like loan amount and loan purpose.
